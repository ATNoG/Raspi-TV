# Raspi-T.v2

Raspi-TV (v2) aims to provide an easy to use dashboard, simplifying the process of displaying content grabbed from different sources and keeping it available even when not connected to the internet.  

### What's needed?

The only thing that's necessary is a Raspberry Pi2 (and maybe a working connection to the internet every now and then).

### Sources

Raspi-TV grabs content from
  * RSS feed
  * Dropbox accounts
  * YouTube
  * Twitter

### Installing

Simply run

```sudo bash -c "wget https://github.com/ATNoG/Raspi-TV/raw/master/setup.sh -O - | bash"```

at you Pi2.

### Credits
