# Raspi-T.v2

This file will probably eventually grow. Until then, it will hold a simple line of code which should take care of setting up Raspi-TV from scratch.  
It won't work until I change ownership of this repository though.

```sudo sh -c "wget https://github.com/ATNoG/Raspi-TV/raw/master/setup.sh -O - | sh"```
